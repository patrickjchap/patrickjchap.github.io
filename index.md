### Static Analysis for Vulnerability Testing: OWASP LAPSE


I am planning to use the OWASP LAPSE tool to analyze an already known vulnerable JAVA web application. I want to see the results that come from using LAPSE versus what is already known from my previous findings. This vulnerable web application is part of a research project that I worked on in the past and I already know a fair bit about it.
