### Static Analysis for Vulnerability Testing: OWASP LAPSE


NEED TO SPELL/GRAMMAR CHECK

Software security is a field that is growing rapidly and being more complicated every year. There are so many different attack vectors that it is not possible for a human to check every single possibility by themselves. Software developers need tools to assist them in detecting and fixing security vulnerabilities. A common way to analyze code and detect problems is through the user of static analysis. Static analysis is where we take the static analysis tool and let it run over the actual code. It is a form of whitebox testing and does not require that actual program that we want to test to be running. One such tool was developed by the famous OWASP group called LAPSE. LAPSE is a static analysis tool that can be used as an Eclipse plugin to analyze Java EE programs to check for security vulnerabilities such as Cross-site Scripting, Cross-site Request Forgery, SQL Injection, and a variety of other things.
